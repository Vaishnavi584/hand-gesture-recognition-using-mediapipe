# hand-gesture-recognition-using-mediapipe
Estimate hand pose using MediaPipe (Python version).<br> This is a sample 
program that recognizes hand signs and finger gestures with a simple MLP using the detected key points.

This repository contains the following contents.
* Sample program
* Hand sign recognition model(TFLite)
* Finger gesture recognition model(TFLite)
* Learning data for hand sign recognition and notebook for learning
* Learning data for finger gesture recognition and notebook for learning

# Requirements
* mediapipe 0.8.1
* OpenCV 3.4.2 or Later
* Tensorflow 2.3.0 or Later<br>tf-nightly 2.5.0.dev or later (Only when creating a TFLite for an LSTM model)
* scikit-learn 0.23.2 or Later (Only if you want to display the confusion matrix) 
* matplotlib 3.3.2 or Later (Only if you want to display the confusion matrix)

# Demo
Here's how to run the demo using your webcam.
```bash
python app.py
```

The following options can be specified when running the demo.
* --device<br>Specifying the camera device number (Default：0)
* --width<br>Width at the time of camera capture (Default：960)
* --height<br>Height at the time of camera capture (Default：540)
* --use_static_image_mode<br>Whether to use static_image_mode option for MediaPipe inference (Default：Unspecified)

### app.py
This is a sample program for inference.<br>
In addition, learning data (key points) for hand sign recognition,<br>
You can also collect training data (index finger coordinate history) for finger gesture recognition.

### keypoint_classification.ipynb
This is a model training script for hand sign recognition.

### point_history_classification.ipynb
This is a model training script for finger gesture recognition.

### model/keypoint_classifier
This directory stores files related to hand sign recognition.<br>
The following files are stored.
* Training data(keypoint.csv)
* Trained model(keypoint_classifier.tflite)
* Label data(keypoint_classifier_label.csv)
* Inference module(keypoint_classifier.py)

### model/point_history_classifier
This directory stores files related to finger gesture recognition.<br>
The following files are stored.
* Training data(point_history.csv)

# Training
Hand sign recognition and finger gesture recognition can add and change training data and retrain the model.

### Hand sign recognition training
#### 1.Learning data collection
#### 2.Model training
Open "[keypoint_classification.ipynb](keypoint_classification.ipynb)" in Jupyter Notebook and execute from top to bottom.<br>
To change the number of training data classes, change the value of "NUM_CLASSES = 3" <br>and modify the label of "model/keypoint_classifier/keypoint_classifier_label.csv" as appropriate.<br><br>
#### X.Model structure
The image of the model prepared in "[keypoint_classification.ipynb](keypoint_classification.ipynb)" is as follows.

In the initial state, 4 types of learning data are included: stationary (class ID: 0), clockwise (class ID: 1), counterclockwise (class ID: 2), and moving (class ID: 4). <br>
If necessary, add 5 or later, or delete the existing data of csv to prepare the training data.<br>

#### 2.Model training
Open "[point_history_classification.ipynb](point_history_classification.ipynb)" in Jupyter Notebook and execute from top to bottom.<br>
To change the number of training data classes, change the value of "NUM_CLASSES = 4" and <br>modify the label of "model/point_history_classifier/point_history_classifier_label.csv" as appropriate. <br><br>

#### X.Model structure
The image of the model prepared in "[point_history_classification.ipynb](point_history_classification.ipynb)" is as follows.

The model using "LSTM" is as follows. <br>Please change "use_lstm = False" to "True" when using (tf-nightly required (as of 2020/12/16))<br>
